				Welcome to the SL Technology Knowledge Base!
			</h2>

			<p>
				Supporting LIFE is an entirely open source project which hopes to make a substantial difference in the remotest parts of Africa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Supporting LIFE uses mobile and web-based architectural solutions. We develop in Java for android-based devices to create dynamic and robust 
				decision-making tools to assist medical professionals out in the field.
			</p>
			<p>	
				We use RESTful web services to coordinate medical data flow to our web 
				servers running on Amazon EC2 instances. Our middle-tier is constructed using the Spring framework, JPA and Maven. The web-based front-end 
				uses HTML 5.0, Bootstrap, JQuery, Ajax, with a little bit of CSS 3.0 animation thrown in for good measure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An agile scrum-based development methodology is followed aiming to deliver frequent and regular software updates throughout the development lifecycle.
				We're big fans of automated testing, and especially Jenkins, to ensure the logical sanity of  our android and middle-tier solutions!
			</p>
			<p>
				If any of the above sounds interesting, we're always excited in hearing from individuals who would like to help us out!.
			</p>
